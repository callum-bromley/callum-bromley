## About me!

Kia ora! Iâ€™m Callum, a full-stack developer with a unique background in customer service and hands-on roles, now channelling that real-world experience into building thoughtful, user-focused software.

Before moving into tech, I worked across a range of industries - from bartending at student clubs and maintaining attractions at Rainbowâ€™s End, to fundraising for charities and cleaning parks. These experiences taught me the value of teamwork, clear communication, and practical problem-solving - skills I now bring to every development project.

As a developer, I work across both front-end and back-end technologies, specialising in JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, and database tools like Knex. Iâ€™ve built a range of personal and group projects that reflect my passion for responsive, user-friendly design.

Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and always looking for opportunities to grow, contribute to meaningful work, and take on new technical challenges.


## Projects:

### Business Website:

With having a family member with an up and coming business, I found it as an opportunity to not only help him out but use it for me to enhance on my skills. 

Although this website may come across as a more simpler project, it really gave me time to home in on React and Typescript frameworks.

### Motivating Mike:

Motivating Mike is a to-do list app with attitude. Add tasks, choose a severity level (1â€“3), and pick one of three characters to encourage you â€” whether thatâ€™s a gentle nudge or a full-on heckle. The higher the severity, the more urgent (and intense) the motivation. Level 3 tasks always come first, so no more dodging the big stuff!

Itâ€™s productivity with personality â€” built using modern full-stack tools and a focus on fun, user-first interaction.
