## About me!

Kia ora! Iâ€™m Callum, a full-stack developer with a unique background in customer service and hands-on roles, now channelling that real-world experience into building thoughtful, user-focused software.

Before moving into tech, I worked across a range of industries - from bartending at student clubs and maintaining attractions at Rainbowâ€™s End, to fundraising for charities and cleaning parks. These experiences taught me the value of teamwork, clear communication, and practical problem-solving - skills I now bring to every development project.

As a developer, I work across both front-end and back-end technologies, specialising in JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, and database tools like Knex. Iâ€™ve built a range of personal and group projects that reflect my passion for responsive, user-friendly design.

Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and always looking for opportunities to grow, contribute to meaningful work, and take on new technical challenges.
